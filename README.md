# TEDxUCSD Website
This is the website that homes the future TEDxUCSD website. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Instructions to start
1. Make sure you're a contributor! If you're not one yet, please let me know. 
2. Clone this repository with your command line/terminal! It's much easier than what I taught y'all, here are instructions: (https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)  
3. Once the repository is cloned, make sure it's checked out in a folder. If your folder is still empty once cloning, try `git checkout main` on your terminal 
4. In your command line/terminal you should already be CD'd into the folder but if you're not yet, make sure you are! 
5. Install your node modules folder with `npm install`
6. Start your developmental environment with `npm start`
7. Start coding with the folder open in VS Code!
