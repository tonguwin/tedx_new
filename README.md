# TEDxUCSD Website
This is the website that homes the future TEDxUCSD website. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Instructions to start
1. Make sure you're a contributor! If you're not one yet, please let me know. 
2. Clone this repository with your command line/terminal! It's much easier than what I taught y'all, here are instructions: (https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)  
3. Once the repository is cloned, make sure it's checked out in a folder. If your folder is still empty once cloning, try `git checkout main` on your terminal 
4. In your command line/terminal you should already be CD'd into the folder but if you're not yet, make sure you are! 
5. Install your node modules folder with `npm install`
6. Start your developmental environment with `npm start`
7. Start coding with the folder open in VS Code! 

## List of things you can do! 
If you choose to start doing something, please let the webDev Slack channel know which task specifically you're doing! Once you finish the task, please let the channel know as well with a funny emoji and I will be sure to update the README.md file so that any updates can be crossed off here :)) 

### General
- Figure out how to take the base grid background that lies on each page! 
- Take out Marquee moving train at the bottom of each page. Simply need to delete it the marquee tag (currently leaving this here bc it's fun to look at lol)
- Create a footer that contains IG, FB, etc and push it to each page 

### NavBar 
1. ke the NavBar completely white and navbar font black 
- Change hamburger button from appearing in the middle to appearing in a screen on the right 

### Home/Landing
- Fix spacing (most likely w CSS) with the "Ideas Worth Spreading" Title 
- Play around/add fun random boxes that are clickable 
- Make the 'what is TEDxUCSD' lead to the About Us page

### About 
- (NOT CODE) start to gather a list of each member and create a google forms to gather bios/fun facts/links 
- Make the 'TEDx' in the 'What is TEDxUCSD?' red. This can definitely be googled/stackoverflowed and done easily 

### Blog
- Routing and place on NavBar 
- Set up the skeleton for this 

### Studio 
- Routing and place on NavBar 
- 

### Sponsors 
- Top title that simply reads 'Sponsors' at the top, equipped with the same CSS as the 'About Us' title on the About page 
- 'Current sponsors' implemented after the title of the page 
- Title cards to represent sponsors, can be pulled from About Us page 
- 

## Tips + Advice 
1. Try to use other CSS files and JS files to gather inspiration
2. If you're stuck for more than 10 minutes use Google (stackoverflow is your bff), or just slack the chat! 
3. Start off with beginner tasks (the lower the number, the easier the task) and then inch up to trying a hard task if you're up to the challenge :)) 
4. If you're ever get too overwhelmed, anxious about it, maybe even have a smoll headache - feel free to just STOP! This is supposed to be just a learning experience for y'all and no stress should be put into it! 
5. If you're having trouble with a merge or maybe pull, Slack the webDev channel with a screenshot and we'll all try to help out or hop on a call.
